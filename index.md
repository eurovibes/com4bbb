# Welcome to the com4bbb project

The Beaglobone Black is a TI Sitara AM3359 ARM Cortex-A8 CPU based evaluation
board with two 40pin 100mil pinsockets. These pinsockets can be used for
additional functionality boards called capes. The com4bbb cape enhance the
Beaglebone Black by a ESP32 based WiFi module and a RS485 tranceiver.
